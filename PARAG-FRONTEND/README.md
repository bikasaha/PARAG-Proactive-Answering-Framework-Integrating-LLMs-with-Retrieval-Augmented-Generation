# 🌐 PARAG Frontend

## 🧾 Overview

This directory contains the complete **frontend codebase** of the **PARAG** application — a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered interface that allows users to query and interact with organizational security policy documents seamlessly.

Built with modern JavaScript frameworks, the frontend provides an interactive, responsive UI for real-time queries, powered by large language models and vector search.
