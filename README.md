# 🔐 PARAG: Proactive Answering Framework Integrating LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation

PARAG is a full-stack application designed to help organizations intelligently query their internal policy documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

This repository includes:

- 🧠 A **backend** built with FastAPI for processing PDF documents, indexing them using vector embeddings, and responding to intelligent queries.
- 🌐 A **frontend** built with modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React + Vite + Tailwind) to provide an intuitive user interface.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** (for the backend)
- **Node.js (LTS)** and **npm/yarn** (for the frontend)
- An OpenAI API key

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

To set up and run the application, please follow the detailed instructions provided in the respective component READMEs:

- 📄 [Backend Setup](./PARAG-BACKTEND/README.md)
- 🌐 [Frontend Setup](./PARAG-FRONTEND/README.md)

These guides cover installation, configuration, running instructions, and dependencies.
---

## 📡 Connecting Frontend to Backend

Ensure the backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`. If the frontend fetch requests need configuration, update the endpoint in your fetch logic or environment config.

---

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- Go to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
- Upload a multi-page organizational policy PDF
- Ask: “What are the steps for system isolation in case of a security breach?”
- Receive accurate responses generated by RAG and grounded in your content
